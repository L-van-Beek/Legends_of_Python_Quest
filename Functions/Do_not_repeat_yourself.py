# Assignment: 
# Create a dry.py program and check out the complete list of built-in functions:

# Find 4 built-in functions that we have used previously in the course.
# Pick 1 built-in function that we have not seen before.
# Use each of these once in the program.

# For the new function, try to read the documentation (😵‍💫) or Google it (👍)!

# Add a comment for each built-in function to explain how they work.

# Code: 
# First function introduced in the course: 
print('Hello, user!')
# Another function I learned was:
user_kid1 = input('How old is your first child? \n')
user_kid2 = input('How old are your second child? \n')
# Third function transforms input into nummerical value (integer)
kid1 = int(user_kid1)
kid2 = int(user_kid2)
# and function number 4 calculates the maximum amongst the numbers
old = max(user_kid1, user_kid2)
print('Your oldest child is' +  (old)  + 'years old')
# New function that I have not seen before is: 
import random 
# It imports the library with random numbers
