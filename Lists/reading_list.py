# Task: 
# Let's start a book club by making a list of tech startup books! ðŸ“š

# Create a reading_list.py program that stores the following items in a books list:

# 'Zero to One'
# 'The Lean Startup'
# 'The Mom Test'
# 'Make It Stick'
# 'Life in Code'
# A. Suppose we want to add one more book to the list: 'Zero to Sold'. Can you use a list method to do so?
# B. Let's say we finished reading 'Zero to One' and 'The Lean Startup'. 
# C. Print the updated list out to make sure everything's good to go!

# Code: 
reading_list = ['Zero to One', 'The Lean Startup', 'The Mom Test', 'Make It Stick', 'Life in Code']
reading_list.insert(5, 'Zero to Sold') 
print(reading_list) #A. 
reading_list.remove('Zero to One')
reading_list.pop(0)
print(reading_list) #B.
